# Student name
# Current date
# String Concatenation

# Part 1
# Use concatenation to build and display a string that displays which city and state you live in
#city = 'Traverse city'
#state = 'Michigan'
#print('I live in ' + city + ', ' + state + '.')



# Part 2
# Create a custom message that welcomes the user by first name to a game you created
# Create one variable to store the user's first name
# Create another variable that stores the welcome message
# Use concatenation to create the customized message
#first_name = input('What is your first name?: ')
#welcome_msg = 'Welcome to Jumanji, ' + first_name
#print(welcome_msg)



# Part 3
# Assign a number to your age variable
# Use the built-in Python str( ) function to convert your age to a string (when doing concatenation)
# Use concatenation to display a sentence that tells us your first name and age
#age = 17
#print('My age is ' + str(age) + '.')





# Part 4
# Use an f-string to build and display a string that contains your first name, last name, and your height in inches
#first_name = 'Charles'
#last_name = 'Petoskey'
#height = '67 inches'
#print(f'My first name is {first_name} and my last name is {last_name}, and my height is {height}.')
